# A secure single page application

I'm following the [A Secure Single Page Application](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/#_spring_and_angular_js_a_secure_single_page_application) tutorial. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

## Run the exiting project
Commands to run when you want to run an angular project for the first time:
```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

But you might want to update the node modules:
```bash
npm update
ng serve
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
